1. Introduction
We're in a world full of numbers and complex data, especially in the world of fancy machine learning. How do you make sense of it all? The answer is simple: use pictures! This report will explain how using pictures to show machine learning results can help top executives like you understand what's going on.

2. Why Pictures Matter
2.1. Pictures Make Data Easier
Pictures are like shortcuts for understanding complicated data. Instead of staring at a bunch of numbers, you can look at a picture and instantly get what's happening.

2.2. Spotting Patterns
Pictures help you see patterns and trends that might be hidden in numbers. It's like a map that shows you the way through a data jungle.

2.3. Better Decision-Making
When you see data as pictures, you can make better decisions because you see the big picture clearly. It's like having a guide instead of wandering in the dark.

2.4. Making Things Simple
Complicated data can give anyone a headache. Pictures simplify things, making it easier for you to understand what's going on.

2.5. Talking to Everyone
Not everyone speaks the language of numbers. Pictures are universal â€“ they help you explain complex data to everyone, even if they're not data experts.

3. Good and Bad Pictures
3.1. Good Pictures
Good pictures are clear, relevant, accurate, interactive, and look good. They help you understand things quickly.

3.2. Bad Pictures
Bad pictures are messy, misleading, lack context, are too complicated, or just not suitable for the job. They can confuse you instead of helping.

4. Types of Pictures and When to Use Them
4.1. Scatter Plots
When to Use: Scatter plots are like dots on a graph. Use them when you want to see the connection between two things, like how height relates to weight.

4.2. Bar Charts
When to Use: Bar charts are like tallies for categories. Use them when you want to compare different categories, like sales in different cities.

4.3. Histograms
When to Use: Histograms are for showing how things are spread out. Use them when you want to see how common or rare something is, like how many people are of different heights.

4.4. Line Graphs
When to Use: Line graphs show changes over time. Use them when you want to see how something has changed over the years, like company profits.

4.5. Box Plots
When to Use: Box plots show how data is spread. Use them when you want to know if your data has weird values (outliers) or not, like salaries in a company.

4.6. Sentiment Models
When to Use: Sentiment models help understand feelings in text. Use them when you want to know if people are happy or sad about something based on what they write.

4.7. Stacked Bar Charts
When to Use: Stacked bar charts show parts of a whole. Use them when you want to see how different categories make up a total, like expenses in a budget.

4.8. Pie Charts
When to Use: Pie charts show parts of a whole too. Use them when you want to see the proportion of each part in a total, like what makes up your monthly expenses.
