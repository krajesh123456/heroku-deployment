Our meeting was arranged through online marriage website (samajbandhu.com) . We first met in Delhi at my Wife's cousin's place in September 2017 . It was family meeting together from both the sides and we had normal conversations discussing each others background .
I was on deputation in US , while she was working in Indian Bank as Clerk . Roka happened at her hometown (Ambikapur, Chattisgarh) . We have offered Kangan worth 1 Lakh to my wife . Marraige was planned to be organised at my hometown (Sahibganj , Jharkhand) where the expenses will be shared from both the sides . 
My wife is depression patient (never disclosed before marraige , I came to know only after a year of marraige). We were told they(in-laws) will be sharing all the expenses and also had proposed they will be offering a car . There was no demand from our end . We had to do all the arrangements for marraige in Sahibganj . We had asked to get 45 people from in-laws side will be coming for marraige , but when they finally came it was just the double around 100 . We had to bear all the expenses for 2 days function (Engagement + Marraige) .They have given Rs 10 Lakhs online transfer to my Father's account for marraige function arrangement , which went beyond the estimation due to number of guests for in-laws side that had arrived . We have arranged for Hotel stay, fooding , deocration and marraige preparation for 2 days - 1 for engagement, 1 for marraige . We were engaged on 28th June 2018 and marraied on 29th June 2018 . We went for honeymoon which was completely sponsered by me (nearly 1.5 Lakhs) . I couldn't take my wife immediately as i had to get Visa extension .My wife applied for B1/B2 tourist visa for my wife which got rejected .  I had applied for my visa extension on H1B which got rejected on December 2018 and I flew back to india on 29th December 2018 . My wife conitued with her job in Indian bank in Raipur .She has never wanted to visit (Sahibganj) nor has she ever tried to remain in contact with the family members from very beginning .
We together visited Sahibganj for my elder sister's marraige in 29th Jan 2019 .She was there only for 3-4 days . She started demanding all jeweleries and all her belongings , which she wanted to carry back to her hometown . She created a lot of mess while people were busy preparing for the marraige . We went to Bailya from Sahibganj for my elder sister's wedding . 
After 6 months around August 2019 , she tool sebatical leave for 1 month and returned to Bangalore to stay with me as she was not getting job transfer . I had travelled to Chennai Indian Bank Headoffice for her transfer, but no luck .  While she stayed with me , she was searching for job as she was not satisfied with Bank Clerk job as it required lot of hard work . She got an offer with Amazon as Associate Compliance after which she decided to quit . She moved in with me around Nov 2019 . My family continued to stay in Delhi with my elder sister . While I returned my salary with TCS was little less. She kept torturing me commenting on my low package with TCS , due to which i had to work hard and switch different companies . 
Mar 2020 we travelled to Delhi for Holi festival celebration with my family . Even on that occasion instaed of celebrating with family, she went to her Mausi's place . She tries to avoid the family as much as possible . Covid started once we returned from Delhi .I was affected with very high fever , she hardly took care of me. I used to talk to my family , which she doesn't like and always asked to avoid talking to my family .She had fight with my family members over the phone , even though she hardly takes care of them .She was under depression and we had consulted several therapists here in Bangalore .She has always taken medecine prescribed by doctor from Raipur . My sister expired during Covid Phase2 (24th Apr 2021) in my native (Sahibganj, Jharkhand).Only my mother and sister(expired) were there in sahibganj when the incident occured . My father and sisters (flew from Delhi) and my wife and me (from Bangalore) went to Sahibganj . We did not get support from any of our relatives at that time . My family was still in trauma , me and my family sick (father got covid, me suffering high fever) . Within a period of 2 weeks , she started pushing to move out of my hometown with the reason of her depression . I told her that we will take my mother and father along with us to Bangalore, but she kept persuading stating she wont be able to take care of mother and father . It will be better if they are with my sisters . I had to send them to Lucknow( to my elder sister) .We flew back to Bangalore .
She got pregnant in June 2021 . She was not ready for the kid, after several persuation and Doctor's convinced , she planned to continue with pregnancy . I had to take care of household , cooking , visiting doctors every 2 weeks for my Wife pregnancy tests. All the cost was bored by me . Meanwhile i had booked our Flat here in Gunjur Bangalore with the wife as co-owner. Loan is sanctioned in both our names , however i alone contibute to the EMIs till date . With the burden of current incident(sister expired) that had occured in family , i had to take care of my wife and also run for loans and manage all the set up for the Flat .I had to visit the Flat of the interior set up every now and then . We used to stay in 2 BHK rented house until then . I called my parents in Nov 2021 , as i had to undergo an operation . They helped me with the Flat set up as well . We moved to our new Flat around Jan 2022 . 
On 3rd Mar 2022, my daughter was born . My mother and me along with wife had gone to hospital early morning for the delivery . All was well until we were in hospital . My mother-inlaw , and sister inlaw came 4 days after the baby's delivery .My wife atleast contributed for veggies or small items in household . After they arrived she completely stopped any expenses . My mother-inlaw started creating caos in the house . She along with her daughted would always make fun of my mother and would giggle which caused frustration for us . They wouldn't cook, or even when they prepared something didnot share it with us . My Sister inlaw had come to visit her to be fiancee . Their focus was not on newly born child which required lot more care . 

I am under mental depression from past 2.5 Years . She mentally tortures me . She doesn't take care of me or my kid . 
I have been sick a few times. She doesn't bother even asking about how my health is, if i need medecine or if i had any food .
I have to visit doctor on my own and get medecine. Take care of my supper (Breakfast, lunch , dinner) . I have to cook over the weekends when my cook doesn't come . My inlaws and wife has always been threatening over the call and also when i visited , they will file Flase complaint against me . She doesn't do any household chores , always on phones and act as per instruction from her friends and family .
