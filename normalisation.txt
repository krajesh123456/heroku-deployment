617    EDIT 10/3/15: Since the last update its reset a lot of stuff & it added categories I'd deleted, but it now says "cannot be altered" & cannot be deleted! -- This is the best mood tracker I have seen, it just needs to be able to let you enter data more than just once per day, and hourly graphs would make it perfect. Also the ability to send results by email for safe keeping. I had questions about the app, but there is only 1 page on a site for it and no one you can contact with questions. That...

I've reported the bug and messaged the developers, and heard nothing. Once that's fixed, this will go back to 5.

3) Describe which accuracy scores, if any, beat the null model.
    a) Which was the best model?
      Default count Vectorizer 
    b) Which two tied as the second best model?
      Default count vectorizer on Ngram data set
    c) What do these results tell you?
      In some text classification tasks, especially when the text data is not very complex or doesn't contain important sequential information, simple word-level features may be sufficient. If unigrams are achieving higher accuracy, it suggests that the predictive information for the given task is primarily at the word level rather than in the co-occurrence of words or phrases.


4) Compare the two tokenization models:
vect = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 3))
testVector("Ngram 1-3 model", vect)

vect = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(1, 2))
testVector("Ngram 1-2 model", vect)
  a) Which model had the better accuracy score?
    Ngram 1-3 model has better accuracy .
  b) Why do you think they scored differently?
    It suggests that the inclusion of trigrams is providing additional useful information for the specific text classification task. 
    

5) Compare, and contrast, the train/test split and 5-fold cross validation process used in the testVector function from the code in item 1. Show how each was done in the code and which you would expect better results from.
Train/test split is a technique where the dataset is divided into two parts: one for training the model and one for testing its performance.
Cross-validation is a technique where the dataset is divided into multiple subsets or "folds." In 5-fold cross-validation, the data is split into five equal parts (folds), and the model is trained and tested five times. Each time, a different fold is used as the test set, and the remaining folds are used for training.

R6) esearch the CountVectorizer function used. What do the flags of ngram_range, stop_words, max_df, min_df, and max_features do?
ngram_range: This flag specifies the range of N-grams (contiguous sequences of N words) to consider when extracting features from the text.
stop_words: This flag allows you to specify a list of words to be treated as stop words and ignored during the tokenization process.
max_df:This flag controls the maximum document frequency of a word (or N-gram) in the corpus. It can be specified as an absolute count or a percentage of documents.
min_df: This flag controls the minimum document frequency of a word (or N-gram) in the corpus. It can be specified as an absolute count or a percentage of documents.
max_features: This flag limits the number of features (unique words or N-grams) to be extracted and included in the resulting matrix.

7) Compare, and contrast, count vectorization and term frequency – inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Be sure to include:
  a) When would you use each?
Count Vectorization: Use it when you want to count how many times each word or phrase appears in a document.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Use it when you want to find important words in documents by considering how often they appear in one document compared to all documents.
  b) Which gave the better accuracy results?
Count Vectorization:
  c) Why?
If the language used in your text data is straightforward with limited variation in terms of word usage and context, TF-IDF's ability to capture nuances may not provide a substantial advantage. Count Vectorization, with its simplicity, can be sufficient for such tasks.
