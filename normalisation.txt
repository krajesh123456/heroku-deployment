CREATE TABLE Customer (

CREATE TABLE Product (
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_name VARCHAR(50),
price DECIMAL(10, 2),
category VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Order (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
customer_id INT,
order_date DATE,
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
);

CREATE TABLE OrderDetail (

This SQL code creates four tables: Customer, Product, Order, and OrderDetail. The Customer table contains customer information, the Product table contains product information, the Order table contains order information, and the OrderDetail table contains information about the products in each order. Each table has a primary key, and foreign keys are used to link the tables together.

This schema follows the principles of normalization discussed in this paper. Each table contains atomic values, each non-key attribute depends on the primary key, and there is no transitive dependency between attributes. The relationships between the tables are also clearly defined.

Note that this is just an example, and the actual SQL code may vary depending on the specific requirements of the e-commerce industry.
