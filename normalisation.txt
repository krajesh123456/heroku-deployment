Our meeting was arranged through online marriage website (samajbandhu.com) . We first met in Delhi at my Wife's cousin's place in September 2017 . It was family meeting together from both the sides and we had normal conversations discussing each others background .
I was on deputation in US , while she was working in Indian Bank as Clerk . Roka happened at her hometown (Ambikapur, Chattisgarh) . We have offered Kangan worth 1 Lakh to my wife . Marraige was planned to be organised at my hometown (Sahibganj , Jharkhand) where the expenses will be shared from both the sides . 
My wife is depression patient (never disclosed before marraige , I came to know only after a year of marraige). We were told they(in-laws) will be sharing all the expenses and also had proposed they will be offering a car . There was no demand from our end . We had to do all the arrangements for marraige in Sahibganj . We had asked to get 45 people from in-laws side will be coming for marraige , but when they finally came it was just the double around 100 . We had to bear all the expenses for 2 days function (Engagement + Marraige) .They have given Rs 10 Lakhs online transfer to my Father's account for marraige function arrangement , which went beyond the estimation due to number of guests for in-laws side that had arrived . We have arranged for Hotel stay, fooding , deocration and marraige preparation for 2 days - 1 for engagement, 1 for marraige . We were engaged on 28th June 2018 and marraied on 29th June 2018 . We went for honeymoon which was completely sponsered by me (nearly 1.5 Lakhs) . I couldn't take my wife immediately as i had to get Visa extension .My wife applied for B1/B2 tourist visa for my wife which got rejected .  I had applied for my visa extension on H1B which got rejected on December 2018 and I flew back to india on 29th December 2018 . My wife conitued with her job in Indian bank in Raipur .She has never wanted to visit (Sahibganj) nor has she ever tried to remain in contact with the family members from very beginning .
We together visited Sahibganj for my elder sister's marraige in 29th Jan 2019 .She was there only for 3-4 days . She started demanding all jeweleries and all her belongings , which she wanted to carry back to her hometown . She created a lot of mess while people were busy preparing for the marraige . We went to Bailya from Sahibganj for my elder sister's wedding . 
After 6 months around August 2020 , she tool sebatical leave for 1 month and returned to Bangalore to stay with me as she was not getting job transfer . I had travelled to Chennai Indian Bank Headoffice for her transfer, but no luck .  While she stayed with me , she was searching for job as she was not satisfied with Bank job and required lot of hard work . She got an offer with Amazon as Associate Compliance after which she decided to quit . She moved in with me around Nov 2020 . My family continued to stay in Delhi with my elder sister .

I am under mental depression from past 2.5 Years . She mentally tortures me . She doesn't take care of me or my kid . 
I have been sick a few times. She doesn't bother even asking about how my health is, if i need medecine or if i had any food .
I have to visit doctor on my own and get medecine. Take care of my supper (Breakfast, lunch , dinner) . I have to cook over the weekends when my cook doesn't come . My inlaws and wife has always been threatening over the call and also when i visited , they will file Flase complaint against me . She doesn't do any household chores , always on phones and act as per instruction from her friends and family .
