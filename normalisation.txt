Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. In the e-commerce industry, normalization plays a critical role in ensuring data accuracy, integrity, and consistency. This paper explains the steps taken to normalize a logical model, how relationships were identified, and the rationale for each attribute in each entity.

Step 1: First Normal Form (1NF)
The first step in normalization is to ensure that each attribute of an entity contains atomic values. To achieve this, we divided the entity into smaller entities, and each attribute of these smaller entities holds a single value. For instance, in an e-commerce website, an order entity can be divided into order details, customer, and product entities. The customer entity would contain the customer name, email, phone, and other customer information. The product entity would contain product name, price, category, and other product information, while the order details entity would contain the product id, order id, quantity, and other order information.

Step 2: Second Normal Form (2NF)
The second step is to ensure that each non-key attribute of an entity depends on the primary key of that entity. In the e-commerce industry, we can illustrate this by having an order entity with an order id as the primary key. The order details entity would have product id, order id, and quantity as attributes. The product entity would have product id as the primary key and product name, price, and category as other attributes. The order entity would have customer id as a foreign key to link to the customer entity. This ensures that the non-key attributes depend on the primary key, which prevents data redundancy and inconsistency.

Step 3: Third Normal Form (3NF)
The third step is to ensure that there is no transitive dependency between attributes. A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute. To ensure that there is no transitive dependency, we can illustrate this by having an order entity with an order id as the primary key, customer id as a foreign key, and other order information. The customer entity would have customer id as the primary key, and customer name, email, phone, and other customer information as attributes. The product entity would have product id as the primary key, and product name, price, and category as other attributes. The order details entity would have product id, order id, and quantity as attributes. This ensures that there is no dependency between non-key attributes, which promotes data consistency and accuracy.

Identifying Relationships
Relationships are essential in a relational database as they help to link entities together. In the e-commerce industry, we can identify relationships by examining how entities interact with each other. For instance, an order entity would interact with a customer entity, product entity, and order details entity. The customer entity would interact with the order entity through the customer id, while the product entity would interact with the order details entity through the product id. This ensures that there is a proper link between entities, which helps to reduce data redundancy and inconsistency.

Attributes in Entities
Each entity in a database should have the appropriate number of attributes to work in a realistic environment. In the e-commerce industry, the customer entity would have attributes such as customer id, customer name, email, phone, and other customer information. The product entity would have attributes such as product id, product name, price, category, and other product information. The order entity would have attributes such as order id, customer id, order date, and other order information. The order details entity would have attributes such as order detail id, order id, product id, quantity, and other order information. Each attribute was carefully selected based on its relevance to the entity.
