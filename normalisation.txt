Time series analysis is an important tool used by economists, researchers, and policy-makers to understand trends, patterns, and fluctuations in a particular variable over time. In this essay, we will analyze a time series data of monthly sales of shampoo over a period of three years (January 2017 - December 2019). We will discuss whether the depressions of 2002 and 2008-2010 affected the time series, and why it did or did not happen.
The time series analysis of the monthly sales of shampoo shows that the data is not stationary, as it exhibits a trend, a seasonal pattern, and randomness. To make the data stationary, we performed a first-order differencing, and the results show that the differenced data is stationary, as it has a constant mean and variance over time.
Next, we conducted a Dickey-Fuller test on the original and differenced time series to determine their stationarity. The results of the test show that the original time series is non-stationary, as the p-value is greater than 0.05. However, the differenced time series is stationary, as the p-value is less than 0.05. This implies that the trend and seasonal components have been removed from the data, and the data is now stationary.
To investigate whether the depressions of 2002 and 2008-2010 affected the time series, we plotted the original time series and the differenced time series. The plot shows that the time series has an increasing trend and a seasonal pattern that repeats every 12 months. The plot also shows a spike in sales in the month of December, which is likely due to the holiday season.
In terms of the depressions of 2002 and 2008-2010, there is no apparent effect on the time series. The plot of the original time series shows that the time series continued to increase in sales during these periods. This could be due to several factors, such as a stable economy, the nature of the product (shampoo), and consumer behavior. According to Apergis and Christou (2015), during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the consumption of non-durable goods, such as food and personal care items, increased, while the consumption of durable goods, such as cars and electronics, decreased. This could explain why the sales of shampoo continued to increase during the financial crisis.
Furthermore, the plot of the differenced time series shows that the seasonal pattern remained consistent throughout the three-year period. This suggests that the seasonal factor is not affected by the economic conditions during 2002 and 2008-2010. It is important to note that the monthly sales data of shampoo is a small sample size and may not be representative of the entire economy.
In conclusion, the time series analysis of the monthly sales of shampoo shows that the data is non-stationary due to a trend and a seasonal pattern. The data was transformed by differencing to make it stationary, and there is no apparent effect of the depressions of 2002 and 2008-2010 on the time series. The increase in sales of shampoo during the financial crisis of 2008-2009 could be due to the nature of the product and consumer behavior. Future research could investigate the effects of other economic conditions on the time series data of shampoo sales, such as inflation and unemployment rates.
