How many characteristics of big data are described in the paper? 
- The paper talks about four important things that make up big data: volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. This information can be found on page 1 of the PDF.

What are the 3 V’s defining big data analytics that are described in the paper? What do they mean? 
- The paper talks about three important things that make up big data analytics: volume, velocity, and variety. 

Volume means the amount of data that is generated by people or organizations. As more and more data is created every day, companies are looking for ways to handle all of it.

Velocity means how quickly data is generated, captured and shared. People and businesses now create more data in shorter amounts of time.

Variety means the different types of data that are available for analysis. This includes structured data (like numbers and dates) and unstructured data (like text and images). 



Are the 3V parameters going to be the same for defining big data in different organizations? Is it possible to define big data using one or two V’s? Why or why not? 
- The paper suggests that most organizations use the three V's (volume, velocity, and variety) to define big data. However, some organizations may focus more on one or two V's depending on their specific needs. For example, an organization that deals with a lot of data but doesn't need to analyze it quickly may focus more on volume than velocity. Similarly, an organization that deals with many different types of data may focus more on variety than volume or velocity. 

So while the three V's are commonly used to define big data, organizations can choose to prioritize one or two V's based on what they need.

What are some specific examples of big data used in the healthcare industry?
- Big data analytics has the potential to transform the way healthcare providers use sophisticated technologies to gain insight from their clinical and other data repositories and make informed decisions. However, it also notes that big data analytics and applications in healthcare are at a nascent stage of development. It can solve issues such as guaranteeing privacy, safeguarding security, establishing standards and governance, and continually improving the tools and technologies will garner attention. 

According to the paper and the assigned reading, what are the opportunities for big data analytics in health care? 
- Big data analytics can help healthcare providers make better decisions, improve patient care, and reduce costs. By analyzing large amounts of data from different sources, big data can help identify patterns and anomalies that may not be visible otherwise. Some specific opportunities for big data in healthcare include improving clinical decision-making, enhancing patient experience, making healthcare operations more efficient, and improving population health management.


According to the paper and the assigned reading, what are the challenges for big data analytics in health care? 
- Big data analytics in healthcare include issues related to privacy and security, making sure the data is accurate, combining data from different sources, and dealing with the complexity of healthcare data.  People will need to pay more attention to issues like privacy, security, and making sure everyone is following the same rules. So while big data analytics has many benefits in healthcare, there are also several challenges that need to be addressed before it can be used effectively.

According to the paper, what are the opportunities for predictive analytics to create value in the banking industry? 
- Predictive analytics can create value in the banking industry by providing insights into customer behavior, identifying potential fraud, and improving risk management. 

In your own words, why is the topic of security and fraud detection important to the banking industry?
- Security and fraud detection are important in banking because banks deal with people's money and sensitive information. By using data mining techniques, banks can monitor and analyze big data like transaction records to protect against fraud, phishing, or money laundering. This helps to keep the bank's reputation good, keep customers happy, and prevent financial losses due to fraudulent activities.


Study “Table 1. Summary table of Data Mining applications in banking since 2013.” How would you summarize the techniques used in each sector of the application? What are the majority of techniques used? In your opinion, why are classification techniques mostly used in each sector?
(d) According to the paper, what area do over 80% of financial service organizations globally experience as their top priority? Why do you think this area is a top priority? 
- (a) Table 1 shows that the majority of techniques used in banking are classification techniques like Decision Trees, Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes. These techniques are used in different areas like security and fraud detection, risk management, customer relationship management, and marketing.
(b) Classification techniques are mostly used because they can help to identify patterns and classify data into different categories. For example, they can be used to detect fraud or to target marketing campaigns.
(c) 80% of financial service organizations globally prioritize regulatory compliance. This means that they need to follow rules about things like money laundering and data privacy. If they don't follow these rules, they could get in trouble with the law or lose customers' trust.

According to the paper and the assigned reading, what are the opportunities for data mining in the insurance industry?
- Data mining can help insurance companies in several ways. It can help them identify things that might cause them to make or lose money, like risks and claims. It can also help them predict when someone might be trying to cheat the system by making a false claim. Data mining can also help companies understand their customers better, so they know what kind of policies they might want to buy. 

According to the paper and the assigned reading, what are the challenges for data mining in the insurance industry? 
- Data mining can be difficult for insurance companies because they have a lot of data to process, and some of that data might not be accurate or complete. This can make it harder to get useful information from the data.

Brainstorm and describe at least one more opportunity for big data analytics in the insurance industry. 
- Insurance companies can use big data analytics to improve customer service. By analyzing customer data, they can learn what their customers want and need, and use that information to provide better service. For example, they could use data to identify common problems that customers have with their policies or claims, and then work to fix those problems. They could also use data to offer customers products or services that are tailored to their specific needs. This could help insurance companies build stronger relationships with their customers and keep them happy.
