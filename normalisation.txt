1) Research and summarize the purpose of the Python mechanize module. Include what its purpo
cookies. Conclude with why that can be important for automated bots.
The "mechanize" module helps our program act like a person on the internet, filling out forms, clicking links, and using cookies to do things on website .This cookie is like a special key that tells the website we're logged in. If our program wants to do things on the website that require us to be logged in, it needs to use that cookie key. Otherwise, the website won't recognize your program as being logged in, and it won't let it do the stuff we want to do.

2) A MAC address is like our home address. MAC address helps computers and devices talk to each other on the internet. It's used to make sure that information goes to the right place.Spoofing means pretending to be someone else.

3) 
Check Ether count for aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff:
This choice helps us count how many times a special code (like a secret password for devices) with the name "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff" appears in the packets we've collected from the network. We count how often this code appears as the starting point of these packets.

Check DNS round robin queries:
This is like looking at messages on the network. We try to find messages that ask about the names of websites. Sometimes, these messages are shared between different websites in a circle. We look at these messages and tell you the names of the websites that are part of this circle.

Check source port 135 access:
Imagine the network as a big highway. Sometimes, vehicles on the highway have a specific number. We're checking if any vehicles are using a number called "135" as their special number when they're starting their journey on the highway. We count how many times this happens.

Check for denial of service (DoS):
Some tricky people might try to overload the network with too much information, causing trouble. We're like detectives looking for signs of this trickiness. We check special information in the network packets to see if someone is trying to do this trick. If we find any signs, we count them to let you know.

Check reset flag:
On the network, when devices want to stop talking to each other, they send a special signal, like raising a white flag. We're watching out for these flags in the network messages. If we see any of these white flags, we count them to tell you how many times devices are trying to stop talking to each other.

Visualize protocol traffic count:
Sometimes it's hard to understand lots of numbers, so we make pictures to help. We have a list of different types of messages on the network, like letters going back and forth. We count how many times each type of message appears, and then we make a picture that shows these counts using bars. This makes it easy to see which type of message is used the most.

Quit program:
If we're done using the program and want to stop it, we choose this option. It's like saying "bye" to the program, and it will close down so we can do something else.



4) 
Network Reconnaissance: Scapy allows attackers to send custom packets to discover network devices and open ports.
Packet Spoofing: Attackers can forge packets using Scapy to impersonate legitimate sources and manipulate traffic.
Denial of Service (DoS): Scapy facilitates the creation of packets that can flood systems, causing service disruption.
Protocol Exploitation: Scapy aids attackers in crafting packets that exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols.


Reconnaissance:
Reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target system or organization to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

1. Shodan:

Description: Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices. It indexes information about various devices, including servers, routers, webcams, and more.
Usage: Attackers use Shodan to discover exposed devices with vulnerabilities, open ports, and misconfigurations that can be exploited.
2. theHarvester:

Description: theHarvester is a tool for gathering email addresses, subdomains, and other related information from public sources like search engines, social media, and more.
Usage: Attackers use theHarvester to collect valuable information for targeted phishing attacks and to build a comprehensive profile of their target.



Certainly, I'll discuss three tools for each of the selected categories: Reconnaissance and Scanning. These are commonly used stages in a cyber attack.

Reconnaissance:
Reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target system or organization to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

1. Shodan:

Description: Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices. It indexes information about various devices, including servers, routers, webcams, and more.

2. theHarvester:

Description: theHarvester is a tool for gathering email addresses, subdomains, and other related information from public sources like search engines, social media, and more.
Usage: Attackers use theHarvester to collect valuable information for targeted phishing attacks and to build a comprehensive profile of their target.
3. Maltego:

Description: Maltego is a data mining tool that visually maps relationships between people, organizations, websites, and more.
Usage: Attackers use Maltego to create detailed profiles of targets, identify interconnected assets, and visualize potential attack vectors.
Scanning:
Scanning involves probing a target's network to identify active hosts, open ports, and services running on those ports.

1. Nmap (Network Mapper):

Description: Nmap is a widely used network scanning tool that can discover hosts, services, and open ports on a network.
Usage: Attackers utilize Nmap to identify potential entry points into a network and gather information about services and versions to exploit known vulnerabilities.
2. Nessus:

Description: Nessus is a vulnerability scanner that identifies security vulnerabilities on hosts and network services.
Usage: Attackers can repurpose Nessus for identifying weaknesses in target systems, which can help them select the most effective attack vectors.
3. Nikto:

Description: Nikto is a web server scanner that identifies potential security issues on web servers and applications.
Usage: Attackers use Nikto to discover vulnerabilities in web applications, which can be exploited to compromise the web server or gain unauthorized access.
Both reconnaissance and scanning are critical stages in cyber attacks, as they provide attackers with the necessary information to plan and execute their strategies. On the defensive side, organizations should implement proper security measures, such as regular vulnerability assessments and network monitoring, to detect and mitigate potential threats during these stages.

Reconnaissance:

Shodan: Imagine a search engine for devices like cameras and computers. Bad actors use it to find devices that are not well protected, like houses with unlocked doors.

theHarvester: This tool is like a detective that finds email addresses and secrets hidden on the internet. Attackers use it to find information to trick people.

Maltego: Think of it as a map that shows how things are connected online, like who knows who. Attackers use it to learn about victims and find weak points.

Scanning:

Nmap: It's like a special radar that checks if doors are open in a computer. Attackers use it to see which doors are open and might be easy to break into.

Nessus: This tool is like a superhero that finds hidden weak points in computers. Attackers might use it to know where to attack.

Nikto: Imagine a guard that checks if a website is safe. Attackers use Nikto to see if websites have problems that they can use to get in.

Remember, these tools can be used for good or bad purposes. It's important to use them ethically and responsibly.
