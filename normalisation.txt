The model developed and analyzed is a binary classification model aimed at predicting whether a customer will churn or not in a retail banking context. The dataset used in this analysis contains information on customer demographics, credit score, balance, tenure, and estimated salary.

The first step in the analysis was to calculate the variance of the different variables in the dataset. The results showed that the balance and estimated salary have the highest variance, which suggests that these variables have a higher level of variability in the dataset.

Next, logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models were developed and evaluated for their predictive performance. The logistic regression model resulted in a confusion matrix with 2311 true negatives, 62 false positives, 575 false negatives, and 52 true positives. The SVM model had an accuracy of 81%, with a precision of 0.82 and recall of 0.98 for the negative class and a precision of 0.70 and recall of 0.16 for the positive class. The F1-score was 0.89 for the negative class and 0.26 for the positive class.

Overall, the results suggest that the SVM model outperformed the logistic regression model in predicting customer churn in the retail banking context. However, the precision and recall for the positive class were low, indicating that the model may not be effective in identifying customers who are likely to churn. This could potentially lead to missed opportunities to retain valuable customers.

To improve the performance of the model, additional features could be added to the dataset, such as transactional data or customer satisfaction ratings. Moreover, more advanced machine learning techniques could be applied, such as deep learning algorithms, to further enhance the predictive power of the model.

In conclusion, the model developed and analyzed provides a starting point for predicting customer churn in retail banking. However, further improvements are needed to increase the accuracy of the model and reduce false negatives, which can be achieved through the addition of more relevant features and more sophisticated modeling techniques.
